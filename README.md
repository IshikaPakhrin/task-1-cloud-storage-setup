# Task 1: Cloud Storage Setup

## Abstract
In this task, I created and configured a cloud storage bucket using AWS S3. A uniquely named bucket was set up in the US East (N. Virginia) region. I uploaded sample files and managed their access permissions to allow public viewing. Since the bucket had Bucket Owner Enforced settings enabled, I used object-level ACL permissions to make the files accessible. This task helped me understand cloud storage fundamentals and permission management.

## Files Included
- Image (sample file)
- Screenshot(s) showing bucket configuration and public file access

## Tools Used
- AWS S3
- GitHub
